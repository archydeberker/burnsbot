# Burns Bot

This project creates a Slackbot which produces poetry in the style of Robert Burns, as generated by a Markov chain model. Code is included to train the Markov model and run the bot.

## Getting started
To install the bot on your slack team of choice, you will need admin access. Go to https://api.slack.com/bot-users and follow the instructions there to setup a bot user. Slack provides two pieces of information which much be saved as environmental variables. To do this, use the commands:
	
	export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_sb_token
	export BOT_ID=your_bot_id


These two pieces of information confirm that your bot has the ability to read and write to your Slack channel. Be sure not to disclose them.

## Installation

To install the dependencies required to run this package, simply run

	pip install -r requirements.txt


## Running your bot

In order for your bot to respond to a Slack message, it must be permanently running on a server. You can use Heroku - the project includes a Profile suitable for use on a Heroku instance - but you will need to find a way of keeping the instance awake, as merely messaging the bot will not suffice. I used a ping service provided by the add-on [New Relic](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/newrelic).

Alternatively, if you already have a Python equipped server you can host your bot there. Our Burns bot is hosted on the ASI data science platform, [Sherlock ML](https://www.sherlockml.com).

## Bot behaviour

Currently, the bot is limited to responding to messages in which it is tagged (@burnsbot), including the command 'write' and a number. It will respond with the specified number of lines of Burns-esque poetry. 

More sophisticated behaviours might include writing acrostics to trace out specific words (by specifying the first letter of each line), 'poems of the day' produced on a schedule, or semi-relevant injection of Burnsesque poetry into ongoing conversations between other Slack users.

## Other ideas

A similar framework could be used to provide a bot modelled on your favourite author; snippets from your favourite coding language; song lyrics; even song notes (if you could find a way of playing them in Slack). Fork away and go nuts.

## Acknowledgements

Much of the Slackbot code comes from this [blogpost](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html) and the associated [github repo](https://github.com/mattmakai/slack-starterbot).

I am indebted to [Alberto Favaro](https://github.com/albertofavaro) for the idea and for providing a Burns corpus in JSON form. Thanks to [ASI Data Science](https://www.asidatascience.com) for hosting the Burns night event.
